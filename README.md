## Hi there 👋

I'm a 3D technical artist and a Blender addon developer. I code mainly in Python, though I've created some projects with JavaScript/HTML/CSS as well.

- 🔭 I'm a lifelong advocate for open source software and have contributed code to Mozilla.
- 🤝 I currently volunteer for the Hubs Foundation as a moderator and web designer.
- 📚 I'm trying to get more experience with lower-level languages like C++.
- 🪩 I've been [creating 3D art](https://www.artstation.com/theanine) since 2010 for game engines like Source, Unreal, Unity, and some more obscure ones too.
- 🕹️ Fun fact: My favorite videogames of all time include Phantasy Star Online, Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask, and Mother 3.
- 🛠️ I love a challenge! If you have an interesting feature request for one of my projects, send it my way.
